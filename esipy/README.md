# ESIPy Fork for Python 3.10+

The original [ESIPy](https://github.com/ESIpy/ESIpy) library only supports Python versions up to 3.9 due to its dependency on [pyswagger](https://github.com/mission-liao/pyswagger), which is not maintained for newer Python versions.

This module is a copy of ESIPy, updated and patched to support Python 3.10 and above. All changes are made here to ensure compatibility with future Python versions.

**Note:** If you are using Python 3.9 or below, you should use the original ESIPy package. Use this fork only if you require support for Python 3.10+.
